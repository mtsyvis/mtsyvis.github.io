        I am a third year student of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. My major is Information System and Technology in economics. At the university I have studied various disciplines, such as computer science in the context of C, operating systems, object-oriented programming in the context of C ++, computer networks, databases. I have developed 4 coursxe projects. The first two projects were console applications developed in C and C++ programming languages. One of the projects was a client-server desktop .Net application using a graphical interfase and a database connection. I have used Windows Forms such as presentation layer technology and ORM framework called Entity Framework for connection to MS Sql Server. And one of the projects was developed in Java programming language and using javaFX. Also i acquired some knowledge in Java and JavaFX during developing of desktop information system. And some words about javascript experience, I created web application, using such technologies as Node.js, Express, Mongodb, Jquery, Ajax, CSS3 and HTML5.

            I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack
            developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing,
            and async mechanisms).
        </p>
        <p>
           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
        </p>
